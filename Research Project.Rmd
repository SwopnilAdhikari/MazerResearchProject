#Look into mixed models. a \<- lmer(StemBiomass \~ matid + patid) . thats the code you should be using to look at regression. Then to get variance of maternal id and paternal id in relation to stem biomass youll use the code : varcomp(a)\#

```{r}
practice <- lmer(Log_Stem_Biomass_MC ~ 1 + 1|Donor:Recipient, AC_MeanCentered_AllTransects)
summary(practice)
ranef(practice)#values of the mean centered biomass. if positive its higher then mean of biomass#
library(jtools)
summ(practice)
#summary lmer tells us stdev among recipients. j tools does the same. if the values is the same tis just more reassuring ICC in jtools tells us how similar they are to one another. higher the value, more similar recipients within donor. Being within the same donor, recipients are necessarily close to each other. If value is 1, then all the recipients are very similar#
library(lmerTest) #tells us if significantly different or not
ranova(practice)#runs model with/without random effect and tells us if running model with effect explains more variation in stembiomass then without effect# In this case the value (0.002239) is showing including the effect explains more then 0. Running ranova tells us whether each of the random effects(if more then one) is signifcantly more then 0. if value is less then .05 then it is significant.
